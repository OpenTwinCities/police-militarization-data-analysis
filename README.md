This project aims to make the Defense Logistics Agency (**DLA**) Law Enforcement   
Support Office (**LESO**) data on the transfer of excess Department of Defense  
property to federal, state and local law enforcemnt agencies easier to analyze  
and track. The data is made public quarterly as directed by the __National  
Defense Authorization Act of 2016__ (FY16NDAA). Projects that clean, clarify and  
analyze the data are welcome. 

As of July 2020 the original data files are published at the
